# Database Synchronization Strategy Analysis

## Current System Overview
The existing workflow synchronizes data between SQL DB and SQLite:
- Initial sync: Full data synchronization
- Subsequent syncs: Incremental updates based on change tracking
- Known issue: Some changes occasionally fail to sync to SQLite

## Proposed Solutions Analysis

### 1. Weekly Full Table Comparison

A periodic full comparison between source and target databases to identify drifts.

**Advantages:**
- Comprehensive detection of all types of discrepancies (inserts, updates, deletes)
- Acts as a safety net for catching accumulated sync issues
- Provides detailed drift analysis that can help identify patterns in sync failures
- Can be scheduled during off-peak hours to minimize impact

**Disadvantages:**
- Resource-intensive operation, especially for large tables
- Weekly cadence means issues might persist for up to a week
- Requires significant network bandwidth for comparison
- May impact database performance during comparison
- Complex to implement efficient comparison for large datasets

### 2. Post-Sync ID Comparison

Comparing IDs between source and target after each sync operation.

**Advantages:**
- Immediate detection of missing or extra records
- Lightweight compared to full table comparison
- Can quickly trigger resync for specific records
- Minimal impact on system resources
- Easier to implement than full comparison

**Disadvantages:**
- Cannot detect updated records (only missing/extra)
- Risk of false positives if checking during active changes
- Needs careful transaction handling to ensure consistent snapshot
- May miss complex data issues beyond simple ID presence
- Additional overhead after every sync operation

### 3. Count-Based Monitoring with Selective Resync

Periodic count comparison with automatic resync on mismatch.

**Advantages:**
- Very lightweight monitoring approach
- Easy to implement and maintain
- Quick detection of significant sync issues
- Automatic recovery through resync
- Can help identify problematic tables through resync patterns

**Disadvantages:**
- Cannot detect one-for-one replacements
- May trigger unnecessary full resyncs
- Count matches don't guarantee data consistency
- 12-hour window might be too long for critical data
- Potential for unnecessary resource usage if counts mismatch frequently

## Additional Strategy Proposals

### 4. Checksum-Based Verification

Implement row-level or table-level checksums for quick comparison.

**Advantages:**
- More accurate than simple count comparison
- Can detect content changes, not just presence/absence
- Relatively lightweight compared to full comparison
- Can be implemented at various granularity levels

**Disadvantages:**
- Additional storage needed for checksum values
- Computation overhead for checksum generation
- Complex to implement for large tables
- May need careful handling of floating-point values

### 5. Hybrid Approach: Tiered Verification

Combine multiple strategies based on table criticality and size.

**Advantages:**
- Optimized resource usage based on table importance
- Flexible and customizable approach
- Can provide both quick detection and thorough verification
- Balances accuracy with performance

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to implement and maintain
- Requires clear classification of tables
- May need more sophisticated monitoring
- Higher initial setup effort

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Short-term Solution:**
   - Implement strategy #3 (count-based monitoring) as a quick win
   - Add detailed logging of sync issues
   - Reduce check interval for critical tables

2. **Medium-term Solution:**
   - Develop hybrid approach combining:
     - Count-based monitoring for quick checks
     - ID comparison for critical tables
     - Weekly full comparison for comprehensive verification

3. **Long-term Considerations:**
   - Implement checksum-based verification for most critical tables
   - Develop automated recovery procedures
   - Create monitoring dashboard for sync status
   - Consider implementing real-time sync for critical tables

## Monitoring and Maintenance Considerations

- Implement detailed logging for all sync operations
- Create alerts for sync failures and discrepancies
- Maintain history of sync issues for pattern analysis
- Regular review of sync performance and failure patterns
- Document recovery procedures for different types of sync failures
