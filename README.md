---

### 3. **Extracting User Details**
**Code:**
```python
user_details = request.data.get('user_details')
email = user_details.get('email')
title = user_details.get('title')
company_name = user_details.get('company')
phone = user_details.get('phone')
address = user_details.get('address')
```
**Purpose:** Retrieves user details for documentation or communication purposes.  
**Explanation:** Ensures traceability and allows for providing personalized results, such as addressing users by their names and sending customized reports.

```
**Purpose:** Converts area from square meters to square feet (for India).  
**Explanation:** Aligns calculations with HVAC industry standards that use square feet for HVAC measurements (1 sq. meter = 10.7639 sq. feet). For example, converting 60,000 sq. meters results in 645,834 sq. feet.

---

### 7. **Default Working Hours by Building Type**
**Code:**
```python
working_hours = request.data.get('working_hours') or 3000
if building_type == 'Office':
    working_hours = 3000
elif building_type == 'University/College':
    working_hours = 5000
elif building_type in ['Hospital', 'Hotel', 'Data Center']:
    working_hours = 8760
elif building_type == 'Mall':
    working_hours = 5000
```
**Purpose:** Establishes typical working hours for different building types.  
**Explanation:** This is essential for calculating energy consumption accurately. For instance, an office operates for 3,000 hours a year, whereas a hospital runs 24/7 (8,760 hours/year).

---

### 8. **Air Change Percentage**
**Code:**
```python
air_changes_percentages, hvac_percentages, avg_electricity_cost, avg_gas_cost = pick_values_india()
if building_type == 'Office':
    air_changes_percentage = air_changes_percentages[0]
# Similar mappings for other building types
```
**Purpose:** Assigns air exchange rates based on building type.  
**Explanation:** Air exchange rates (e.g., 15% for offices) significantly impact HVAC load calculations, as they affect the building’s heating and cooling needs.

---

### 9. **Location and Weather Data Retrieval**
**Code:**
```python
latitude, longitude = getLocationFromCity(city)
avg_max_temp, avg_min_temp, temp, rel_humidity, dew_point = getAllWeatherData(latitude, longitude)
```
**Purpose:** Fetches geographic data and weather metrics for accurate HVAC load calculations.  
**Explanation:** Weather data such as temperature, humidity, and dew point allows for location-specific HVAC load adjustments.

---

### 10. **Cooling, Ventilation, and Heating Factors**
**Code:**
```python
cooling_factor = 0.75
ventilation_factor = 0.6
fan_speed = 0.8
```
**Purpose:** Sets standard factors for HVAC load calculations, adjusted by building type.  
**Explanation:** These factors are crucial for accurate HVAC load calculations, as they consider the operational efficiency of systems, such as ventilation and cooling in various building types.

---

### 11. **HVAC Load Calculations**
- **Cooling Load**
  **Code:**
  ```python
  cooling_load[i] = getLatentHeat(avg_max_temp[i], rel_humidity[i], CFM, air_changes_percentage) * adjustment_factor
  ```
  **Purpose:** Computes monthly cooling loads based on temperature, humidity, air changes, and operational hours.  
  **Explanation:** Identifies cooling energy requirements to optimize HVAC usage and reduce costs. For example, the cooling load for an office would be calculated using the latent heat of the air, adjusted for factors like air changes and CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute).

- **Heating Load**
  **Code:**
  ```python
  heating_load[i] = (0.24 * 0.0761 * 60 * area * (air_changes_percentage * (temperature_required - avg_min_temp[i]))) / 100000
  ```
  **Purpose:** Calculates heating loads for colder months.  
  **Explanation:** Heating load is determined by factors such as building area, air changes, and the difference between the required temperature and the outside temperature. This helps in budgeting for heating needs.

---

### 12. **Energy Cost Calculations**
- **Annual Cooling/Heating Costs**
  **Code:**
  ```python
  annual_cooling_cost = annual_cooling * electricity_cost
  annual_heating_cost = annual_heating * gas_cost
  ```
  **Purpose:** Computes the costs for cooling and heating based on energy consumption and average rates.  
  **Explanation:** This breakdown helps in estimating the total monetary cost for energy consumption (e.g., $/kWh for electricity, $/therm for gas).

- **Ventilation Costs**
  **Code:**
  ```python
  ventilation_energy = (CFM * 1.4) / 1750
  annual_ventilation_energy_cost = ventilation_energy * ventilation_hours * electricity_cost
  ```
  **Purpose:** Calculates energy and cost of ventilation systems.  
  **Explanation:** Breaks down HVAC costs into components, providing clarity on ventilation energy consumption and cost optimization.

---

### 13. **Total and Benchmark Costs**
**Code:**
```python
benchmark = annual_cooling_cost + annual_heating_cost + annual_ventilation_energy_cost
```
**Purpose:** Aggregates all HVAC costs to establish a benchmark.  
**Explanation:** This provides a baseline cost for energy consumption, helping identify areas for potential savings by optimizing HVAC systems.

---

### 14. **Savings and ROI**
**Code:**
```python
potential_hvac_savings = benchmark_without_olaam - benchmark
total_percentage_savings = (potential_hvac_savings / benchmark_without_olaam) * 100
```
**Purpose:** Quantifies potential savings from optimization.  
**Explanation:** This calculates the return on investment (ROI) for implementing energy-efficient solutions, showing the potential savings when optimization (like OLAAM) is applied.

---

### 15. **Final Outputs**
**Code:**  
Print statements for benchmark costs, savings, and results.  
**Explanation:** The final outputs display the computed benchmark costs, potential savings, and energy efficiency metrics, providing clear insights for stakeholders to make informed decisions.
