To change the permissions of your Telegram bot to read all text messages, you need to make sure the bot has the necessary administrative privileges in the chat or group where you want it to operate. Here's how you can grant these permissions:

1. Add Your Bot to the Chat or Group:
   - Make sure your bot is a member of the chat or group where you want it to read all text messages. If your bot is not already a member, you can invite it just like you would invite any other user.

2. Make Your Bot an Administrator:
   - Once the bot is a member of the chat or group, you'll need to promote it to be an administrator to give it the necessary permissions. To do this, follow these steps:
   
   - Open the Telegram chat or group where your bot is added.
   - Tap on the group name or header to access group settings (or use the three dots menu in the top right corner and select "Manage Group").
   - In the group settings, select "Administrators" or a similar option, depending on your Telegram client.
   - Find your bot in the list of members and tap on it.
   - Choose the "Make Admin" or "Add Administrator" option.
   - You may need to specify the permissions you want to grant to the bot. At a minimum, you should grant "Read Messages" or similar permissions that allow the bot to see messages.

3. Save Changes:
   - After you've added your bot as an administrator and configured the necessary permissions, save the changes.

4. Restart Your Bot:
   - If your bot was already running, you may need to restart it for the changes to take effect. Stop the bot and run it again.

Once you've completed these steps, your bot should have the necessary permissions to read all text messages in the chat or group. Please note that the exact steps and options in the Telegram app may vary slightly depending on your platform (iOS, Android, desktop, etc.), but the general process of adding the bot as an administrator is the same.

Keep in mind that bots should always respect user privacy and follow Telegram's terms of service. Reading and processing messages in a way that violates privacy or terms of service is not recommended and may lead to the bot being blocked or banned.
